# Sacre Davey Company Re-Designed Website
Developed by Fergus and Lisa

##About
This is a custom WordPress theme for an engineering firm called Sacre Davey. The design was given by UX Design students from RED Academy 2016 Summer.

##Tools and Methods Used
+ **WordPress** - The new site is built on WordPress with a customized theme. The site itself has many content that the company wishes to display to users, so we used some plugins to allow these content to be more user-editable as their company is still growing and more projects and sectors are being added. We also included custom post types for their "Sectors" and "Projects" sections and using Custom Field Suite plugin, the company is able to easily add as many sectors/projects as they would like without having to open an editor.
+ **JavaScript/jQuery** - Throughout the website, there were several places where the designed asked for a slider for users to scroll through. We were able to accomplish that with the incorporation of Flickity slider. Using jQuery and JavaScript, we customized each of the slider to our needs and accomplished making 2 sliders, one acting as a navigation to the other. 
We also used JS to make certain content and the mobile navigation bar display on click.
+ **PHP/CSS3** - All pages are developed through PHP and styled with CSS. By installing the Custom Field Suite plugin, we were able to created customized loops that displays content in specific sections using PHP. The most notable usage of the loop is on the single-sectors.php where the company is able to upload images which will be looped through and set as background image in their respective section.
+ **Git** - This is the first project that we have the experience of working with Git with more than 1 person. By using the rebase command, we were able to keep the master branch always up-to-date with our local branches and thus version control our custom theme.

##General Overall
As the first community project we have both worked on, we feel that it has been a great experience working in a team. At the beginning, there were a couple of merge conflicts issues which we resolved together and have now reduced the number of merge conflicts at every rebase command. The re-designed website had many pages and due to the content, the design are not all uniform across certain post type. It was challenging coming up with methods to work around it and to try to keep the theme looking as close to the design as possible.

Overall, we feel that this was a good demonstration of our skills as new developers and the methods that we have learned will be carried with us further down the road.
